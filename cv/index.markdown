## Profile Summary

As a Senior Developer at Gravitate, I build websites and applications for our clients, mentor the development and design teams and help steer the technology direction of the company.

Outside of 9am and 5:30pm I wear my co-founder hat for Luumin whose colour is actually a rapid blur of all the other hats I'm switching between as the demands of a bootstraped startup change.  

I have a passion for front end development, principally JavaScript. This has been fostered by an understanding of The Good Parts, supported by a mature development community and the availability of modern frameworks.

I have a view that although technology is rapidly changing, the web will be with us for a long time.  I like to advocate a mobile first, progressive enhancement approach to design which I believe just makes better websites.

I love the New Zealand web community, and regularly attend local meet ups having presented on designing large applications with Javascript in 2012 at AKJS.
