* For a while I've wanted to automatically generate unique hero images for blog posts.
  * Save time on finding usable graphics
  * Something that can form an identifiable fun relationship to the content when shared across platforms
  * Something that could be seeded from the content so based on what is authored, the generated art reflects this.
