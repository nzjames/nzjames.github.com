I wonder how Eleventy deals with sites that grow over time.

It feels like it is independent of the static site generation and is more a concern of syncing/uploading the site.

I've used sync on S3 successfully to reduce uploads for sites with minor diffs, but I'll need to look into what I'll need to do with my current fly.io setup as it will probably be a whole docker image being uploaded.
