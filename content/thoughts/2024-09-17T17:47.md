I want to generate the glitch hero sans title overlay.

This will blow out the playwright test time to capture more screenshots as I've been re-capturing 2 screenshots and an svg for each post every build.

This was never going to scale but was fine while it was on localhost.

As a simple step. I've added a file stat to any image artifact generated in the glitch phase.

This post will test if it works for real.
