After a few false starts I've got something working that feels like it will serve the IA I've been after.

Goals I've been thinking about for this site.

* #james-thinks-out-loud / working title "Thoughts" is somewhere between tweets and stream of consciousness
* Posts are probably more considered and maybe have some copy editing.
* Bare bones authoring tools to make it easy to update
* Static site because who wants to run a DB these days.

Behind the scenes I've got a staging environment and a production environment, more relevant to development of the site than content updates but still nice to have.

My existing (now previous) site was an absolute place holder. Now I'm looking for something that I can post updates to and syndicate them out to social media if it makes sense.

It feels like owning your own content is more important in 2024 than any time that may have come before.

This is a base blog build using the Eleventy 3.0.0 alpha/beta/nightly what evs. I'm kinda jazzed that Zac got it to ESM.
