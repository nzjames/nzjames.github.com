Meta og images still elude most posts at least in Feedly my RSS viewer, tests in other places work.

When debugging it best practice to change one thing and test. A frustrating thing with Feedly and RSS is the refresh cycle is not consistent.

Anywhoo, I padded out the other og meta properties (probably valuable anyway). And I through in the `twiter:image` meta.

I try again.
