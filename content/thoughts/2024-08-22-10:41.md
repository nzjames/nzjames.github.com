I got inline SVGs working this morning. I smashed around Eleventy as I couldn't figure out some of the more recent techniques.

I ended up with an async shortcode that just read the file off the filesystem and echoed it out.

I got around to reading the bare minimum about svg viewboxes and figured out a quick crop and reset of width and height attribs.

I could go back to the SVG generation, but I've got enough to keep moving forward.
