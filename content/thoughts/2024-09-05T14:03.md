I think I've got `<meta property="og:image" ...>` tags working.

Lots of false starts trying to figure out how to get Eleventy to to give me the tag with a url that matched the optimised glitch URLs.

I had issues with importing the correct esm `Image` not `{ Image }`.
I had issues resolving paths as they are different from the ones used in the automatic transform.

I eventually figured out a modified version of `eleventy-image` [Make your own Markup](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#make-your-own-markup) would work when I lined up the other bits I had wrong.
```
	eleventyConfig.addShortcode("metaImage", async function (path, fileName) {
		if (!path || !fileName) {
			return "";
		} else {
			try {
				const src = `content/${path}/img/banner/${fileName}.png`;
				let metadata = await Image(src, {
					widths: [1200],
					formats: ["png"],
				});

				let data = metadata.png[metadata.png.length - 1];
				return `<meta property="og:image" content="${data.url}" />`;
			} catch (e) {
				console.log("No image found for ", path, fileName);
			}
		}
	});
```
