One pomodoro in for the day and starting to look at CSS

* Eleventy comes with very little, not too much to reset.
* I might bring in something like https://picocss.com/
* I went looking for what the Prisim css that is currently being included is for turns out it is a code block syntax highlighter. So I'll leave it.

I got my heading font in and I adjusted the build to use an included CSS file over inlining to each file.

Time for a break.
